# Elastic Security - Security Associate training material

Elastic Security is a cybersecurity solution built on the Elastic Stack (formerly known as the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). It provides a unified platform for threat detection, investigation, and response (TDIR) by centralizing and analyzing security data at scale.

Elastic Security combines log analytics, threat detection, and endpoint protection into a single, open platform. Itâ€™s used by security operations centers (SOCs) and IT teams to detect and respond to threats faster, using a flexible and scalable architecture. 

In this hands-on workshop the atttendee learns the fundamental skills needed to understand the concepts en start set up a SIEM system and creating Detection Rules using Elastic Security. Main topics are mentioned in the [Labs](labs/README.md).
 
The hands-on part is fully scenario based, including helpful [lab exercises](labs/README.md).
 
Wait for the trainer when starting with lab material.

 ## Next Steps

You are ready to start with the introduction into the [Labs](labs/README.md).

Additional I want to give a credits to the ElasticSearch community and my Security friends for sharing such great material (and being part).

Enjoy the training labs!!!
