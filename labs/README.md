# Labs Introduction

These labs will give the full experience of deploying, discover, visualize, creating detection-rules and more using Elastic Security. Every lab contains several exercises to complete.

If you are unable to complete certain exercises, no problem. You can always complete the other labs.

| 0   | [Prerequisites](00-prereqs/README.md) | Prereqs to setup the environment|
| 1   | [Introduction](01-introduction/README.md)| In this lab during the exercises attendees will learn howto spin-up a full Elastic-Stack using Docker containers.|
| 2   | [Elastic Stack as Fundament](02-StackFoundation/README.md) | In this lab during the exercises attendees will learn about the Elastic Stack foundations, such as Kibana and Spaces.|
| 3   | [Advanced Ingestion Tools](03-AdvancedIngestion/README.md) | In this lab during the exercises attendees will learn about advanced ingestion capabilities like elastic agent, beats, logstash and more.|
| 4   | [Detections & Alerts](04-DetectionsAlerts/README.md) | In this lab during the exercises attendees will learn about detections, detection-rules, alerts and optimizing to prevent False-Positives and detection-rule optimalization/tuning.|

## Prerequisites

You may use any `Elastic Stack` environment, but as minimum we advice the following prerequisites that are part of [Lab 0](00-prereqs/README.md). For simplicity we are making use of a demo deployment using `Docker compose`. Keep in mind this is for training purposes only!!

- 2 or more (virtual) CPUs available.
- At least 16G of Memory.
- Approx 5 GB available for storage.

** This training is developed and tested using Elastic Stack 8.17.4 release **

## Next Steps

You are ready to start with the first lab about [Prerequisites](00-prereqs/README.md) setting up Elastic Stack with Podman Compose.

Enjoy the exercises!!!
